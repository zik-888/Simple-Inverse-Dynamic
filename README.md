# Simple-Inverse-Dynamic
The repository contains a script for solving the inverse problem of dynamics using the RNEA (Recursive Newton-Euler Algorithm). The script contains a description of the model, as well as a method for solving it, implemented in C#.
The project uses the MathNet.Numerics library. Kinematic and dynamic parameters of the kuka_kr6r700 manipulator are introduced in the default constructor.

You can read more about the method:

- the book Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms (RBDA)
- Springer Handbook of Robotics
